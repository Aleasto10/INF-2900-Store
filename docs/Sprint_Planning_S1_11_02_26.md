# Sprint Backlog

In order to designate story points for our first sprint we used planning poker and discussed amount of points for each task. For most tasks our estimates only differed in 1 point making it so the estimates were discussed fairly quickly.

# Goal of the sprint
The goal of this sprint is to implement a structure and framework, and to use this to implement some basic features that allows the e-commerce store to function in its MVP(Minimum Viable Product), essentially a scaffolding and a foundation for us to create the actual store we cwant to make.
